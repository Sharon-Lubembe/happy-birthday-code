        <p> I studied in various schools but i finished my form four last year

            i didn't pass so much but i know i did what i had to.My school life wasn't easy i was exposed to all sorts of things
            e.g drugs and even sometimes passed where a crime scene is but all in all I survived<br/>schoollife also was fun
            i enjoyed being with my friends doingall sorts of things,being punished together,sharing everything in yerms of advice,
            food oh!especially food and even school items it was hard but being around friends everything seemed so easy.

            but my hope is still at 100% that i will be where i want.I love love cameras,i love being on the limelight camera flashes
            i love makeup,love feeling beautiful and all eyes on me and it's not attention seeking it's just me
